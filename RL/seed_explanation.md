# What is a Seed in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning?

## Definition of Seed
A **seed** is an initial value provided to a random number generator (RNG) to ensure reproducibility of results. When a seed is set, the sequence of random numbers generated remains the same across different runs of the code.

## Why is a Seed Important?
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that experiments produce the same results every time.
- **Debugging & Testing**: Helps in debugging models by maintaining consistent random behaviors.
- **Fair Comparisons**: Ensures that different models are trained on identical random conditions for fair benchmarking.

## How is a Seed Used in Python?
### Setting a Seed in Different Libraries

#### 1. **Python's `random` Library**
```python
import random
random.seed(42)  # Sets the seed for Python's random module
print(random.randint(1, 100))  # Always produces the same output when run multiple times
```

#### 2. **NumPy (Numerical Python)**
```python
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)  # Sets the seed for NumPy's random module
print(np.random.rand(3))  # Generates the same random numbers on every execution
```

#### 3. **PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)**
```python
import torch
torch.manual_seed(42)  # Sets the seed for PyTorch's random number generator
print(torch.rand(3))  # Ensures the same random numbers across different runs
```

#### 4. **TensorFlow (Another Deep Learning Framework)**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.random.set_seed(42)  # Ensures TensorFlow generates the same random numbers each time
print(tf.random.uniform([3]))
```

## Seed in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
In RL, randomness is involved in:
- **Environment behavior** (random initial states, stochastic transitions)
- **Agent behavior** (random action selection, exploration strategies)
- **Weight initialization** in neural networks

Setting a seed in RL ensures that:
- The environment starts in the same state.
- The agent follows the same exploration-exploitation path.
- Model training remains consistent across multiple runs.

## Example: Setting a Seed in Gymnasium (RL Environments)
```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
import torch
import random

# Set seeds for reproducibility
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
env.reset(seed=42)  # Ensures the environment starts in the same state
env.action_space.seed(42)  # Ensures actions taken are reproducible
```

## Summary
- **Seed ensures reproducibility** by controlling randomness.
- **Different libraries have their own seed functions**, so setting it in all libraries used is important.
- **In RL, seeds help compare different models fairly** and maintain consistency in training.
