## Introduction to LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets. They can generate, summarize, translate, and answer questions in natural language. Popular open-source LLMs include Llama2, GPT-Neo, and MPT.

---

## Core Concepts of LLMs
### What is an LLM?
An LLM is a neural network (usually transformer-based) that predicts the next word in a sequence, enabling it to generate coherent text and understand context.

### Embeddings
Embeddings are vector representations of words, sentences, or documents. They capture semantic meaning and are used for similarity search, clustering, and more.

### Tokenization
Tokenization splits text into smaller units (tokens) for processing by the model. Libraries like HuggingFace's `tokenizers` make this easy.

### Training and Fine-Tuning
- **Training:** Building a model from scratch using a large dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain using additional data.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge sources (like vector databases) to answer queries with up-to-date information.

### CAG (Context-Augmented Generation)
CAG enriches prompts with user history, metadata, or other context before passing to the LLM, improving personalization and relevance.

### Prompt Engineering
Designing effective prompts to guide LLMs toward desired outputs.

## Choosing an Open Source LLM Base
Popular choices:
- [Llama2](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama)
- [GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo)
- [MPT](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry)
- [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)

You can run these models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or HuggingFace Transformers.

## Setting Up Your Python Environment
```bash
# Install Python packages
pip install torch transformers datasets ollama
```

---

## Training Your Own LLM
### Data Preparation
Prepare a text dataset (e.g., plain text, JSONL). For custom tasks, use domain-specific data.

### Model Training Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments, TextDataset

# Load tokenizer and model
model_name = "gpt2"  # The base model to start with (can be replaced with any open-source LLM)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)  # Loads the model architecture and weights
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)  # Loads the tokenizer for splitting text into tokens

# Prepare dataset
# 'train.txt' should be a plain text file with your training data
# block_size is the number of tokens per training example
dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path="train.txt",
    block_size=128
)

# Training arguments
# Define training configuration
# output_dir: where to save the trained model and checkpoints
# num_train_epochs: number of complete passes through the dataset
#   - More epochs can improve learning but risk overfitting
#   - Each epoch helps the model refine its understanding of patterns
# per_device_train_batch_size: number of samples processed at once per GPU/CPU
#   - Larger batches use more memory but can speed up training
#   - Smaller batches may provide better generalization
# save_steps: checkpoint frequency (in training steps)
#   - Allows resuming training if interrupted
# save_total_limit: maximum number of checkpoints to keep
#   - Prevents disk space issues by removing older checkpoints
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Trainer
# Combines model, data, and training arguments
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset
)
trainer.train()  # Starts the training process
```

---

## Fine-Tuning an LLM
### Fine-Tuning Example
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments, TextDataset, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Prepare fine-tuning dataset
# 'finetune.txt' should contain text relevant to your specific task/domain
dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path="finetune.txt", block_size=128)

# Training arguments for fine-tuning
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./finetune_results", num_train_epochs=1)

# Trainer for fine-tuning
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset)
trainer.train()  # Starts fine-tuning
```

---

## Implementing RAG and CAG
### RAG Example
```python
import requests
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Simulate retrieval of context from a vector database
context = "Ollama is a tool for running LLMs locally."  # Retrieved relevant info
query = "What is Ollama?"  # User's question

# Combine context and query into a prompt for the LLM
prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Tokenize the prompt (convert text to model input)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate answer using the LLM
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])  # Convert model output tokens back to text
print(answer)
```

### CAG Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

user_history = "User previously asked about Python."  # Example user context
query = "Tell me more about Python."  # Current user question
context = f"History: {user_history}"
prompt = f"{context}\nCurrent question: {query}"  # Combine context and question

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Tokenize and generate response
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(answer)
```

## Prompt Engineering Tips
- Be clear and specific in your instructions (e.g., "Summarize this text in one sentence.")
- Use examples in your prompts (e.g., "Q: What is Python?\nA: Python is a programming language.")
- Test and iterate to improve resultsâ€”try different phrasings and see what works best

---

## Running and Validating Your Trained LLM

Once you have trained or fine-tuned your LLM, you can run it and validate its output:

### Example: Running the Model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load your trained or fine-tuned model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./results")  # Path to your trained model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

prompt = "Explain the difference between AI and ML."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print("Model response:", response)
```

### How to Validate Output
- Check if the response is relevant, accurate, and clear
- Try multiple prompts to see consistency
- Compare with expected answers or ground truth

### How to Improve Model Responses
- Add more or better quality training data
- Fine-tune with examples similar to your target use case
- Use prompt engineering to guide the model
- Adjust model parameters (e.g., temperature, max_length)
- Regularly evaluate and iterate based on feedback
