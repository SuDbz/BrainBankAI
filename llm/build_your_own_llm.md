## Introduction to LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive text datasets. They can generate, summarize, translate, and answer questions in natural language. Popular open-source LLMs include Llama2, GPT-Neo, and MPT.

---

## Core Concepts of LLMs
### What is an LLM?
An LLM is a neural network (usually transformer-based) that predicts the next word in a sequence, enabling it to generate coherent text and understand context.

### Embeddings
Embeddings are vector representations of words, sentences, or documents. They capture semantic meaning and are used for similarity search, clustering, and more.

### Tokenization
Tokenization splits text into smaller units (tokens) for processing by the model. Libraries like HuggingFace's `tokenizers` make this easy.

### Training and Fine-Tuning
- **Training:** Building a model from scratch using a large dataset.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain using additional data.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge sources (like vector databases) to answer queries with up-to-date information.

### CAG (Context-Augmented Generation)
CAG enriches prompts with user history, metadata, or other context before passing to the LLM, improving personalization and relevance.

### Prompt Engineering
Designing effective prompts to guide LLMs toward desired outputs.

## Choosing an Open Source LLM Base
Popular choices:
- [Llama2](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama)
- [GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo)
- [MPT](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry)
- [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)

You can run these models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or HuggingFace Transformers.

## Setting Up Your Python Environment

```bash
# Install Python packages
pip install torch        # PyTorch: Deep learning framework for model training and inference
pip install transformers # HuggingFace Transformers: Provides pre-trained models and utilities
pip install datasets     # HuggingFace Datasets: Tools for working with ML datasets
pip install ollama       # Ollama Python client: Interface with locally running LLMs
```

## Training Your Own LLM
### Data Preparation
Prepare a text dataset (e.g., plain text, JSONL). For custom tasks, use domain-specific data.

### Model Training Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments, TextDataset

# Load tokenizer and model
# Loading the model and tokenizer for language generation:
# - `AutoModelForCausalLM`: A class from the Hugging Face transformers library that automatically loads 
#     the appropriate language model architecture based on the provided model name.
#     It's designed for causal language modeling (next token prediction) like GPT models.
# - `AutoTokenizer`: A class from the transformers library that handles text preprocessing, 
#     converting raw text into numerical tokens that the model can understand.
#     It also handles special tokens, vocabulary, and text normalization.
# - `gpt2`: A pre-trained language model developed by OpenAI that can generate coherent text.

model_name = "gpt2"  # The base model to start with (can be replaced with any open-source LLM)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)  # Loads the model architecture and weights
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)  # Loads the tokenizer for splitting text into tokens

# Prepare dataset
# 'train.txt' should be a plain text file with your training data
# block_size is the number of tokens per training example
dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path="train.txt",
    block_size=128
)

# Training arguments
# Define training configuration
# output_dir: where to save the trained model and checkpoints
# num_train_epochs: number of complete passes through the dataset
#   - More epochs can improve learning but risk overfitting
#   - Each epoch helps the model refine its understanding of patterns
# per_device_train_batch_size: number of samples processed at once per GPU/CPU
#   - Larger batches use more memory but can speed up training
#   - Smaller batches may provide better generalization
# save_steps: checkpoint frequency (in training steps)
#   - Allows resuming training if interrupted
# save_total_limit: maximum number of checkpoints to keep
#   - Prevents disk space issues by removing older checkpoints
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Trainer
# Combines model, data, and training arguments
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset
)
trainer.train()  # Starts the training process
```

---

## Fine-Tuning an LLM
### Fine-Tuning Example
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, Trainer, TrainingArguments, TextDataset, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Prepare fine-tuning dataset
# 'finetune.txt' should contain text relevant to your specific task/domain
dataset = TextDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer, file_path="finetune.txt", block_size=128)

# Training arguments for fine-tuning
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./finetune_results", num_train_epochs=1)

# Trainer for fine-tuning
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset)
trainer.train()  # Starts fine-tuning
```

---

## Implementing RAG and CAG

### RAG Example (Simple)
```python
import requests
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Simulate retrieval of context from a vector database
context = "Ollama is a tool for running LLMs locally."  # Retrieved relevant info
query = "What is Ollama?"  # User's question

# Combine context and query into a prompt for the LLM
prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Tokenize the prompt (convert text to model input)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate answer using the LLM
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])  # Convert model output tokens back to text
print(answer)
```

### RAG with Vector Database (Recommended Workflow)

#### Step 1: Create and Store Document Embeddings in a Vector DB
```python
import chromadb
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Example documents
docs = ["Python is a programming language.", "Ollama runs LLMs locally."]

# Create ChromaDB collection
client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection(name="knowledge_base")

# Compute and store embeddings for each document (one-time operation)
for doc in docs:
    embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=doc, model="text-embedding-ada-002")['data'][0]['embedding']
    collection.add(documents=[doc], embeddings=[embedding])
```

#### Step 2: Query the Vector DB for Relevant Context
```python
import numpy as np

query = "What is Ollama?"
# Tokenize and embed the query
query_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=query, model="text-embedding-ada-002")['data'][0]['embedding']

# Search for the most similar document in the vector DB
results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=1)
context = results['documents'][0]  # Most relevant context from DB
```

#### Step 3: Pass Context to LLM for Generation
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

prompt = f"Context: {context}\nQuestion: {query}"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(answer)
```

---

**Summary:**
- Document embeddings are created and stored in a vector database once.
- For each query, only the query is tokenized and embedded, and the vector DB is used to identify the most relevant context.
- The LLM then uses this context to generate a response.

This workflow is efficient and scalable for real-world RAG systems.


### CAG Example
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

user_history = "User previously asked about Python."  # Example user context
query = "Tell me more about Python."  # Current user question
context = f"History: {user_history}"
prompt = f"{context}\nCurrent question: {query}"  # Combine context and question

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Tokenize and generate response
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(answer)
```

---


## Prompt Engineering Tips
- Be clear and specific in your instructions (e.g., "Summarize this text in one sentence.")
- Use examples in your prompts (e.g., "Q: What is Python?\nA: Python is a programming language.")
- Test and iterate to improve results—try different phrasings and see what works best

## Running and Validating Your Trained LLM

Once you have trained or fine-tuned your LLM, you can run it and validate its output:

### Example: Running the Model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load your trained or fine-tuned model

# This code loads a trained causal language model from the "./results" directory into memory. 
# The `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()` function:
# 1. Automatically detects the model architecture from the saved configuration
# 2. Loads the trained model weights and parameters
# 3. Initializes the model in evaluation mode

# The "./results" directory typically contains:
# - model_config.json: Configuration file with model architecture details
# - pytorch_model.bin: The trained model weights
# - tokenizer files (if saved with the model)
# - training_args.json: Arguments used during training (if saved)
# 
# The second line loads the GPT-2 tokenizer, which is necessary for processing text inputs before passing them to the model. Note that 
# the tokenizer loaded here is the base GPT-2 tokenizer, not a potentially custom tokenizer from the training results.

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./results")  # Path to your trained model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

prompt = "Explain the difference between AI and ML."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print("Model response:", response)

```

Alternative: Using Ollama for local LLM inference

```python
# This approach lets you run models locally with less code

import ollama

# Run inference using your local Ollama instance
# To use your own custom trained model with Ollama:
# 1. First export your trained model from HuggingFace format
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load your trained model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./results")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./results")

# Export to GGUF format (requires gguf conversion tools)
# This is a simplified representation - actual conversion requires additional steps
# See: https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/tree/master/examples/gguf

# 2. Create an Ollama model file (Modelfile)
"""
# This points to your model in GGUF format
# GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary format for efficient model storage
# Note: This file won't be automatically created in ./results - you need to convert 
# your model from PyTorch format to GGUF format using conversion tools like 
# llama.cpp's converter
FROM ./your-exported-model.gguf


# Controls randomness in output generation
# Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make responses more deterministic and focused
# Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make responses more creative and diverse
PARAMETER temperature 0.7



# Nucleus sampling parameter - controls token selection diversity
# The model will only consider tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds this value
# Lower values create more focused/predictable responses
# Higher values allow more variety in word choice
PARAMETER top_p 0.9


# Defines a sequence that stops text generation when encountered
# Useful for chat interfaces to prevent the model from generating the next user prompt
PARAMETER stop "User:"
"""

# 3. Create and use your model in Ollama
# In terminal: ollama create mymodel -f Modelfile
# Then in Python:
custom_response = ollama.chat(model='mymodel', messages=[
    {
        'role': 'user',
        'content': 'Explain the difference between AI and ML.'
    }
])
print("Custom model response:", custom_response['message']['content'])
```

### How to Validate Output
- Check if the response is relevant, accurate, and clear
- Try multiple prompts to see consistency
- Compare with expected answers or ground truth

### How to Improve Model Responses
- Add more or better quality training data
- Fine-tune with examples similar to your target use case
- Use prompt engineering to guide the model
- Adjust model parameters (e.g., temperature, max_length)
- Regularly evaluate and iterate based on feedback
