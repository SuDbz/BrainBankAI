# What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is primarily defined as a **protocol** [1, 2], acting as a **standard** for engineers to develop systems that can communicate with each other effectively [1]. It is officially known as the **Model Context Protocol** [2, 3] and was originally introduced by Anthropic (the company behind Claude) [4, 5]. Since its inception, it has become an **open-source standard for building AI agents** [4, 5].

## Concepts

### The Problem MCP Solves for Large Language Models (LLMs)

*   **Inherent Limitations of LLMs**: By themselves, **LLMs are generally incapable of taking meaningful actions or initiating real-world effects** [3, 6, 7]. Their native function is limited to generating responses in forms like text, pictures, or videos, or simply predicting the next word [3, 6, 7].
*   **Challenges with Tool Integration**:
    *   Developers learned to combine LLMs with external "tools" (APIs) to extend their capabilities (e.g., searching the internet, sending emails, or automating tasks via services like Zapier) [6].
    *   However, this approach became **cumbersome, frustrating, and prone to issues at scale** [6, 8]. Manually integrating many different tools can be a "nightmare," especially when external service APIs update, potentially breaking existing connections [8, 9]. This difficulty has been a significant barrier to developing comprehensive, "Jarvis-level" AI assistants [8, 9].
    *   A major issue is that **every service provider constructs their APIs differently**, leading to a feeling of connecting disparate "languages" [4, 9].

### How MCP Provides a Solution for Enhanced AI Capabilities

*   **A Unified Translation Layer**: MCP functions as a **layer positioned between the LLM and various external services or tools** [9]. Its core role is to **translate the diverse "languages" (or API specifications) of these services into a unified language that makes complete sense to the LLM** [4, 9]. This effectively **unifies the LLM and the service**, facilitating efficient communication [5].
*   **Guiding AI Actions**: It acts as a **guide for AIs to select the appropriate APIs and interact with third-party platforms** [4]. By providing agents with the necessary context, MCP enables them to make the correct API calls, thereby making LLMs significantly **more capable** [10].

### MCP Architecture: Client-Server Model

MCP operates on a **client-server model** [5, 11, 12].
*   An **MCP client** is the LLM-facing side, which can be an AI agent or a host application [5, 12]. Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor, Tempo, Winsurf, or GitHub Copilot [5, 13, 14]. An MCP client uses an MCP client library to interact with an MCP server [12]. Importantly, **one client can hook up to as many MCP servers as it wants to** [2, 11].
*   The **MCP server** acts as an intermediary, translating and exposing the capabilities of external services to the client [5, 15]. Servers can be pre-existing solutions built by service providers (who are now creating their own MCP servers to enable LLM access to their services) or custom-built for specific needs [5, 12, 15].
*   **Communication Protocols**: Communication between MCP clients and servers can occur via **Standard Input/Output (IO)**, suitable for applications running locally on the same machine [13, 16, 17]. Alternatively, for remote or web-based applications, **HTTP streaming** (which replaced older Server Sent Events) is used [16, 18]. Messages exchanged over these protocols are typically formatted using **JSON RPC** [18].
*   **Discoverability**: MCP servers define and describe their functionalities to the outside world, often through well-known RESTful endpoints, including a capabilities list that tells the client what it offers [15, 19, 20]. This means clients can **interrogate servers to find out what capabilities they offer** [21].

### Key Components and Capabilities of an MCP Server

An MCP server exposes its functionalities, primarily through four main components, though two are most important [2]:

*   **Tools**: These are pieces of code on the server that an AI client can invoke to **perform specific actions or call functions** within an application or program [2, 22-24]. Tools include descriptions (docstrings) and parameter schemas that guide the LLM on how to use them correctly [22, 25].
    *   Tools can be as simple as creating an Excel document or as complex as performing data computation [2].
    *   They can provide hints to the AI, such as whether an action is destructive, idempotent, read-only, or interacts with the "open world" (external data) [26, 27].
*   **Resources**: These represent **sets of data** that the MCP server can access and provide to the client [28-31]. Resources can be anything from database records, files on a file system, images, or real-time data from a Kafka topic [29, 30, 32].
    *   Resources can also be exposed as **URI templates** to allow dynamic access to specific data items (e.g., getting details for a user by ID) [33, 34].
*   **Prompts**: These are **pre-defined, well-formatted prompts** that the client can request from the server [28, 29]. They serve as structured queries or instructions that help the AI perform specific tasks or generate specific types of responses based on minimal input [29, 35].
*   **Samplings**: This is a distinct capability where the **server requests information *from* the AI (client)** [29, 36]. The server sends a prompt to the client's LLM, asking it to run the prompt and return the result to the server, essentially reversing the typical client-to-server information flow [37, 38]. This is useful when the server needs the AI to generate data or complete a task that the server itself cannot perform [36].

## Examples

### 1. HR Leave Management Agent [13, 22, 28, 39, 40]

*   **Use Case**: Helping an HR manager, Yupta, with employee leave management.
*   **MCP Server**: Built to access an "ATL employees database" (mocked for the tutorial) containing leave information and history [13, 22].
*   **Exposed Capabilities**:
    *   **Tools**: `get_leave_balance` (e.g., for employee E001), `apply_for_leave` (including leave dates), and `get_leave_history` [22, 39, 40].
    *   **Resource**: A simple greeting [28].
*   **Client Interaction (via Claude Desktop)**:
    *   The user (HR manager) can ask natural language questions like "how many leaves are available for employee E001?" [39].
    *   The LLM (Claude 3.7) intelligently maps the user's question to the appropriate tool (e.g., `get_leave_balance`) and supplies the correct argument (employee ID) [39].
    *   It can also handle context, e.g., "for this same person let me know the exit dates" for E001 [39].
    *   When applying for leave, Claude understands flexible date inputs (e.g., "4th July") and converts them into the required format using the tool's docstring [40].

### 2. AI Flight Booking Demo [3, 4, 11, 14, 23, 41-45]

*   **Problem**: Natively, LLMs only provide text instructions; they cannot *book* a flight [3]. Real-world flight booking requires interaction with multiple third-party airline services (Joy Air, Dra Air, Aeroggo) and preference comparison [14].
*   **Solution**: An AI agent, enabled by MCP, interacts with these third-party platforms.
*   **Role of MCP**: MCP acts as a **guide for the AI** to choose the right APIs and provides the necessary context, detailing a service's capabilities (e.g., "search flights" and "book flight" for Joy Air) and their input/output structures [4].
*   **Client Interaction (simulated in VS Code)**:
    *   Initially, without MCP configured, the AI might try to use a browser search [43].
    *   After configuring the MCP server, when asked "Can you check flight details for me from SFO to JFK for today?", the agent uses the configured MCP tool to search for flights [43, 44].
    *   The user can then ask to "book the cheapest flight," and the agent will prompt for necessary passenger details (name, email, phone) before using the MCP tool to execute the booking [44, 45].

### 3. Generic User Management (from Build Tutorial) [25-27, 32-36, 38, 46-53]

This example illustrates the creation of MCP components for a mock user database.

*   **Tool: `create_user`** [25-27, 46]
    *   **Function**: Creates a new user in a mock JSON database file.
    *   **Parameters**: Requires `name`, `email`, `address`, and `phone` (all strings).
    *   **AI Guidance**: The tool's docstring and `annotations` (e.g., `read_only: false`, `destructive: false`, `item_potent: false`, `open_world: true`) are crucial. These hints help the LLM understand the function's side effects and how it interacts with external data, guiding its decision-making and potentially triggering warnings to the user if an action is destructive [26, 27].
    *   **Client Interaction**: Can be invoked directly by typing `#create_user` in a Copilot chat or indirectly through natural language, such as "Can you please create a new user for me with the name Kyle, the email test.com, the address 1 2 3 4 Main Street and the phone..." [47, 48]. The AI parses the request and correctly calls the tool with the provided arguments [48].

*   **Resource: `users`** [32, 48]
    *   **Function**: Returns all user data from the database.
    *   **Client Interaction**: In GitHub Copilot, a user can "add context" of the `users` resource to the chat window. Then, queries like "what is the name of the user with the ID4?" can be answered by the AI referencing the loaded resource data [33, 49].

*   **Resource Template: `user_details`** [33, 34]
    *   **Function**: Allows querying specific user by ID using a templated URI (e.g., `users/{user_id}/profile`).
    *   **Client Interaction**: When accessing this resource, the client prompts for the `user_id` value, then retrieves and displays the specific user's information [35, 53, 54].

*   **Prompt: `generate_fake_user`** [35, 50]
    *   **Function**: Takes a `name` as input and returns a well-formatted prompt for the AI to generate realistic fake user data (email, phone number).
    *   **Client Interaction**: In Copilot, typing `/generate_fake_user` followed by a name (e.g., "Sally") triggers the server to send the formatted prompt to the client's AI, which then generates the fake user data [50].

*   **Tool using Sampling: `create_random_user`** [36, 38, 51]
    *   **Function**: This tool demonstrates **sampling**. It creates a random user with fake data. Instead of generating the data itself, the *server* issues a `sampling/create_message` request back to the *client's* AI [36, 38].
    *   The server provides a prompt to the client's LLM ("generate fake user data...return this data as a JSON object...") [38].
    *   The client's AI runs this prompt, generates the data, and sends it back to the server. The server then uses this generated data to create a new user in its database [38, 51]. This highlights the **bidirectional capability** of MCP [29, 37].

## Other Information

### Benefits of MCP

*   **Pluggability, Discoverability, and Composability**: MCP makes AI agent functionality **pluggable** (new capabilities can be easily added), **discoverable** (AI can find and understand existing capabilities), and **composable** (different components, including other MCP servers, can be combined to build more complex systems) [21, 55].
*   **Streamlined Integration**: It streamlines the complex process of integrating LLMs with diverse external services, significantly **reducing the need for extensive custom "adapter codes"** for each integration [4, 9].
*   **Enabling True Agentic AI**: MCP is seen as a crucial step towards building **true agentic AI in professional and enterprise settings**, enabling AIs to go beyond just generating text and actively perform real-world tasks through structured interactions with various systems [56, 57]. It also facilitates **agent-to-agent communication**, allowing different AI agents to collaborate by discovering each other's capabilities and assigning tasks [11, 58].
*   **Reduced Engineering Burden**: By providing a standardized structure, MCP helps mitigate the "nightmare" scenarios faced by engineers dealing with continuous API updates and the need for custom glue code, leading to more stable and scalable AI applications [9, 10].

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Beyond individual agents leveraging MCP for external services, the sources mention the **agent-to-agent model**, developed by Google [58].
*   This model defines a set of **standards** that allows different AI agents to **discover each other's capabilities**, assign tasks to one another, check their status, and communicate by sharing context and results [58].
*   This means an MCP server can itself act as a client to another MCP server, demonstrating the composability benefit and enabling more complex, collaborative AI systems [21, 55]. For example, a "flight agent" could call a "hotel agent" to book accommodations [11, 58].

### Challenges and Limitations

*   **Setup Annoyance**: Currently, setting up MCP servers can be "annoying" due to various installation and configuration steps involving downloading libraries, moving files, and copying configurations locally [10, 11, 28].
*   **Early Stages**: The standard is still in its early stages. There is discussion about whether MCP has "fully won" as the definitive standard or if it might be challenged, updated, or replaced by another standard in the future [59, 60].
*   **Local Focus in Examples**: While MCP supports HTTP streaming for remote applications, many current examples and tutorials focus on local communication via Standard IO, which is simpler for initial development [16, 17].

### Future Vision and Opportunities

*   MCP is viewed as a **gateway to building true agentic AI** in the enterprise and professional settings [56, 57].
*   There's a potential for an "**MCP App Store**" where developers could easily deploy and access various MCP servers, simplifying integration for others [59].
*   The architecture makes integrations feel like **"Lego pieces" that can be stacked** to build increasingly complex systems [60].
*   For businesses and developers, **staying informed about the evolving MCP standard** is crucial for identifying and capitalizing on future opportunities in the AI space [59, 60].

**Analogy for Understanding MCP:**

Think of MCP as the **universal language translator and operations manual for an AI agent**. Imagine you have a brilliant chef (the LLM) who speaks only one language and knows how to create incredible recipes (text responses). But for the chef to *cook* (take action in the real world), they need ingredients from various markets (external services like databases, email providers, booking systems) and specialized kitchen tools (APIs). Each market and tool speaks a different language and has its own unique instructions.

Without MCP, the chef's assistant (the developer) has to learn *every single language and instruction set* for each market and tool, manually translating every request and response – a tedious and error-prone process.

**MCP steps in like a universal translator that also provides standardized instruction manuals.** Now, the assistant (MCP) can convert the chef's requests into a common language that all markets and tools understand, and translate their responses back to the chef. It also provides the chef with a *standardized manual* for each tool, detailing what it does, what inputs it needs, and what outputs it provides. This way, the chef (AI) can effortlessly "shop" for ingredients, "use" tools, and even "collaborate" with other specialized chefs (other AI agents), all without getting bogged down in the intricacies of each individual system. It allows the chef to focus on the culinary masterpiece (the user's request) rather than wrestling with communication barriers.
