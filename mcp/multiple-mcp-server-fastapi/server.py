Multiple MCP Server FastAPI Integration

This module demonstrates how to combine multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
into a single FastAPI application. It showcases:
1. Combining multiple MCP servers (greet_server and bye_server)
2. Managing server lifecycles with FastAPI lifespan events
3. Mounting MCP servers as HTTP endpoints for external access
4. Proper resource management using AsyncExitStack

Architecture:
- Each MCP server (greet, bye) runs independently with its own tools
- FastAPI acts as a gateway, routing requests to appropriate MCP servers
- HTTP endpoints allow external clients to interact with MCP tools
- Lifespan management ensures servers start/stop cleanly with the main app

    FastAPI Lifespan Event Handler for Multiple MCP Servers
    
    This async context manager handles the startup and shutdown of multiple MCP servers
    within the FastAPI application lifecycle. It ensures that:
    
    1. **Startup Phase**: Both MCP servers are initialized and started before the app serves requests
    2. **Runtime Phase**: All servers remain active and handle requests concurrently  
    3. **Shutdown Phase**: All servers are gracefully stopped when the app shuts down
    
    Why use AsyncExitStack:
    - Manages multiple async context managers (MCP servers) together
    - Ensures proper cleanup even if one server fails to start
    - Handles resources in reverse order of creation (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
    - Provides exception safety - if startup fails, already-started servers are cleaned up
    
    Flow:
    1. Create AsyncExitStack for resource management
    2. Start greet_mcp server and register it for cleanup
    3. Start bye_mcp server and register it for cleanup  
    4. Yield control back to FastAPI (app is now ready to serve requests)
    5. When app shuts down, AsyncExitStack automatically stops servers in reverse order

    async with contextlib.AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        # Register and start the greet server
        # This server handles greeting-related MCP tools (like "echoHai")

        await stack.enter_async_context(greet_mcp.session_manager.run())
        
        # Register and start the bye server  
        # This server handles farewell-related MCP tools (like "echoBye")
        # Both servers run concurrently and independently

        # Yield control back to FastAPI
        # At this point, both MCP servers are running and ready to handle requests
        # The app will serve HTTP requests until shutdown is requested
        yield
        
        # When the context exits (app shutdown), AsyncExitStack automatically:
        # 1. Stops bye_mcp server (last registered, first stopped)
        # 2. Stops greet_mcp server (first registered, last stopped)
        # 3. Cleans up all associated resources
