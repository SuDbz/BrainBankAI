     Advanced LLM Concepts: RAG, CAG, Fine-Tuning, Prompt Engineering, LangGraph, and LangChain  



- [MCP](/mcp/mcp.md)
  
  A standardized protocol that enables AI models to securely connect with external tools and data sources in real-time.

- [AI tools](others/ai_tools.md)
  
  Software applications and utilities that leverage artificial intelligence to automate tasks, analyze data, and enhance productivity.

- [Vector DB](others/vector_db.md)
  
  A vector database is a specialized database designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors (numerical arrays). These vectors typically represent
  data such as text, images, audio, or video after being transformed by machine learning models (embeddings). Vector databases enable efficient similarity search,
  which is crucial for AI, recommendation systems, and semantic search.
